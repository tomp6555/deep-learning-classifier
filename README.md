## 1. Overview

This repository contains code to **train, evaluate, and deploy** a deep learning classifier for images. It leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to learn discriminative features for **binary or multi‑class classification**. The code is written to be **generic** and adaptable to any image classification dataset organized by class folders.

**Core stack:**

* **TensorFlow/Keras** – deep learning model & training
* **OpenCV, NumPy** – image handling, preprocessing, visualization
* **(Optional) scikit‑learn** – metrics & evaluation helpers

---

## 2. Features

* Modular pipeline: **data prep → model → training → inference → visualization**
* End-to-end pipeline for image classification
* Built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV
* Data augmentation to enhance generalization
* Custom CNN model for binary classification tasks
* Visualization of prediction results

---

## 3. Requirements

* Python **3.9–3.11** (tested on **3.10**)
* TensorFlow 2.x, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, scikit‑learn, matplotlib, tqdm, scipy

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python scipy scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm pillow
```

## 4. Model Architecture

A compact CNN works well as a strong baseline for binary classification:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH = 128, 128

def build_model():
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation="relu"),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
        layers.Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")  # Binary classification
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="binary_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])
    return model
```

**Why this architecture?** It’s simple, fast, and robust for small/medium datasets. You can scale depth/width or switch to transfer learning (e.g., EfficientNet) if needed.

## 5. Usage Guide

This section provides instructions on how to train the model and then use the trained model for inference on new images.

### Training the Model

Use the **classifier.py** script. This handles data loading, augmentation, model definition, training, and saving the trained model.

#### Dataset Structure

Organize images into directories by class name. Replace `your_dataset_folder` with the actual path in classifier.py (for example, `./dataset`)

```plaintext
your_dataset_folder/
train
  ├── good/
  │   ├── image_1.jpg
  │   ├── image_2.jpg
  │   └── ...
  └── bad/
      ├── image_3.jpg
      ├── image_4.jpg
      └── ...
```

#### Run training script:
1. **Save the script**: Put `classifier.py` in your working directory. The script should load the data, build the model, train it, and save the trained weights to `classifier_model.h5`
2. **Configure dataset path**: Edit `classifier.py` to set a `data_directory` variable.


### Using the Trained Model for Analysis

Use the **analysis.py** script:
To classify new images using the trained model, you will use the analysis.py script.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the classifier_model.h5 file (generated from training) is in the same directory as `analysis.py`

#### Run analysis script

1. **Save the script**: Put `analysis.py` in your working directory.
2. **Update `input_image_path`**: In the script, point to the image you want to analyze.

The script will:

* Print the predicted class and confidence score.
* Save a new image with overlayed label and score.

---

### Customization

* **Model Architecture:** Swap in pretrained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, etc.) for stronger baselines.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust epochs, batch size, optimizer, and augmentation.
* **Dataset Expansion:** More diverse training data improves performance.
* **Extensions:** Move from classification to detection/segmentation (YOLO, U‑Net, etc.).

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Overfitting**: increase augmentation, add dropout, enable early stopping, reduce model size, collect more data.
- **Underfitting**: train longer, increase model capacity, increase image size, lower augmentation strength.
- **Class imbalance**: use `class_weight`, collect more minority class samples, or apply balanced sampling.
- **Inconsistent results**: fix random seeds, ensure identical preprocessing in training & inference.
- **Slow training**: reduce image size/batch size, use mixed precision on GPU, cache datasets.
